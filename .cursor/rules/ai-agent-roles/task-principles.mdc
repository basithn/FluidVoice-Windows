## 4.2 Principles
1. Each task must have its own dedicated markdown file.
2. Task files must follow the specified naming convention.
3. All required sections must be present and properly filled out.
4. When adding a task to the tasks index, its markdown file MUST be created immediately and linked using the pattern `[description](./<PBI-ID>-<TASK-ID>.md)`.
5. Individual task files must link back to the tasks index using the pattern `[Back to task list](../<tasks-index-file>.md)`.
