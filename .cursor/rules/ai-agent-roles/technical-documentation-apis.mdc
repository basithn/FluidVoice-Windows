13. **Technical Documentation for APIs and Interfaces**: As part of completing any PBI that creates or modifies APIs, services, or interfaces, technical documentation must be created or updated explaining how to use these components. This documentation should include:
    - API usage examples and patterns
    - Interface contracts and expected behaviors
    - Integration guidelines for other developers
    - Configuration options and defaults
    - Error handling and troubleshooting guidance
    - The documentation must be created in the appropriate location (e.g., `docs/technical/` or inline code documentation) and linked from the PBI detail document.
