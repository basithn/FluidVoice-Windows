## 3.6 PBI Detail Documents

> Rationale: Provides a dedicated space for detailed requirements, technical design, and UX considerations for each PBI, ensuring comprehensive documentation and alignment across the team.

- **Location Pattern**: `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/prd.md`
- **Purpose**:
  - Serve as a mini-PRD for the PBI
  - Document the problem space and solution approach
  - Provide technical and UX details beyond what's in the backlog
  - Maintain a single source of truth for all PBI-related information
- **Required Sections**:
  - `# PBI-<ID>: <Title>`
  - `## Overview`
  - `## Problem Statement`
  - `## User Stories`
  - `## Technical Approach`
  - `## UX/UI Considerations`
  - `## Acceptance Criteria`
  - `## Dependencies`
  - `## Open Questions`
  - `## Related Tasks`
- **Linking**:
  - Must link back to the main backlog entry: `[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-<PBI-ID>)`
  - The backlog entry must link to this document: `[View Details](./<PBI-ID>/prd.md)`
- **Ownership**:
  - Created when a PBI moves from "Proposed" to "Agreed"
  - Maintained by the team member implementing the PBI
  - Reviewed during PBI review process
