11. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Information should be defined in a single location and referenced elsewhere to avoid duplication and reduce the risk of inconsistencies. Specifically:
    - Task information should be fully detailed in their dedicated task files and only referenced from other documents.
    - PBI documents should reference the task list rather than duplicating task details.
    - The only exception to this rule is for titles or names (e.g., task names in lists).
    - Any documentation that needs to exist in multiple places should be maintained in a single source of truth and referenced elsewhere.
