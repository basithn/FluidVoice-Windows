## 2.5 Change Management Rules

> Rationale: Defines how changes are managed, requiring explicit association with tasks and strict adherence to scope.

- Conversation about any code change must start by ascertaining the linked PBI or Task before proceeding.
- All changes must be associated with a specific task.
- No changes should be made outside the scope of the current task.
- Any scope creep must be identified, rolled back, and addressed in a new task.
