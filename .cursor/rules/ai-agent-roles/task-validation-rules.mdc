### 4.8.2 Task Validation Rules

> Rationale: Ensures all tasks adhere to required standards and workflows.

1. **Core Rules**:
   - All tasks must be associated with an existing PBI
   - Task IDs must be unique within their parent PBI
   - Tasks must follow the defined workflow states and transitions
   - All required documentation must be completed before marking a task as 'Done'
   - Task history must be maintained for all status changes
   - Only one task per PBI may be 'InProgress' at any time, unless explicitly approved
   - Every task in the tasks index MUST have a corresponding markdown file
   - Task descriptions in the index MUST be linked to their markdown files

2. **Pre-Implementation Checks**:
   - Verify the task exists and is in the correct status before starting work
   - Document the task ID in all related changes
   - List all files that will be modified
   - Get explicit approval before proceeding with implementation

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - If unable to access required files, stop and report the issue
   - For protected files, provide changes in a format that can be manually applied
   - Verify task status in both task file and index before starting work
   - Document all status checks in the task history

4. **Change Management**:
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages
   - Update task status according to workflow
   - Ensure all changes are properly linked to the task
   - Document any deviations from the planned implementation
