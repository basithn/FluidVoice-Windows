## 2.4 Scope Limitations

> Rationale: Prevents unnecessary work and keeps all efforts focused on agreed tasks, avoiding gold plating and scope creep.

- No gold plating or scope creep is allowed.
- All work must be scoped to the specific task at hand.
- Any identified improvements or optimizations must be proposed as separate tasks.
