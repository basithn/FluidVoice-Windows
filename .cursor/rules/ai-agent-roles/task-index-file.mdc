## 4.10 Task Index File

> Rationale: Defines the standard structure for PBI-specific task index files, ensuring a consistent overview of tasks related to a Product Backlog Item.

*   **Location Pattern**: `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/tasks.md`
    *   Example: `docs/delivery/6/tasks.md`
*   **Purpose**: To list all tasks associated with a specific PBI, provide a brief description for each, show their current status, and link to their detailed task files.
*   **Required Sections and Content**:
    1.  **Title**:
        *   Format: `# Tasks for PBI <PBI-ID>: <PBI Title>`
        *   Example: `# Tasks for PBI 6: Ensure enrichment tasks are resilient to service and web page disruption`
    2.  **Introduction Line**:
        *   Format: `This document lists all tasks associated with PBI <PBI-ID>.`
    3.  **Link to Parent PBI**:
        *   Format: `**Parent PBI**: [PBI <PBI-ID>: <PBI Title>](./prd.md)`
        *   Example: `**Parent PBI**: [PBI 6: Ensure enrichment tasks are resilient to service and web page disruption](./prd.md)`
    4.  **Task Summary Section Header**:
        *   Format: `## Task Summary`
    5.  **Task Summary Table**:
        *   Columns: `| Task ID | Name | Status | Description |`
        *   Markdown Table Structure:
            ```markdown
            | Task ID | Name                                     | Status   | Description                        |
            | :------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------- |
            | <ID>    | [<Task Name>](./<PBI-ID>-<TaskNum>.md) | Proposed | <Brief task description>           |
            ```
        *   **`Task ID`**: The unique identifier for the task within the PBI (e.g., `6-1`).
        *   **`Name`**: The full name of the task, formatted as a Markdown link to its individual task file (e.g., `[Define and implement core Circuit Breaker state machine](./6-1.md)`).
        *   **`Status`**: The current status of the task, which must be one of the permitted values defined in Section 4.5 (Status Definitions).
        *   **`Description`**: A brief, one-sentence description of the task's objective.
*   **Prohibited Content**:
    *   The Task Summary table in this file must only contain what is specified, and nothing else, unless a User specifically oks it.
