### 4.9 Version Control for Task Completion

> Rationale: Ensures consistent version control practices when completing tasks, maintaining traceability and automation.

1. **Commit Message Format**:
   - When a task moves from `Review` to `Done`, create a commit with the message:
     ```
     <task_id> <task_description>
     ```
   - Example: `1-7 Add pino logging to help debug database connection issues`

2. **Pull Request**:
   - Title: `[<task_id>] <task_description>`
   - Include a link to the task in the description
   - Ensure all task requirements are met before marking as `Done`

3. **Automation**:
   - When a task is marked as `Done`, run:
     ```bash
     git acp "<task_id> <task_description>"
     ```
   - This command should:
     1. Stage all changes
     2. Create a commit with the specified message
     3. Push to the remote branch

4. **Verification**:
   - Ensure the commit appears in the task's history
   - Confirm the task status is updated in both the task file and index
   - Verify the commit message follows the required format
